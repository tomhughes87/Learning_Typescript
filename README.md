## How?

### The Course:
An amazing course by Colt Steele on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-typescript/

<br/>
<br/>

### Getting the most out of learning:

Here are some techniques I used to reenforce the learning process:

- Although some sections of the course are short, I have spent many hours practicing the areas covered.

- I changed all of the examples in the videos and personalised them to re-enforce the learning process.

- I would often watch the intro to a section and then try to solve the upcoming problems.

- I made notes and organized examples of .ts features for 'future me' so that I have cheatsheets and references to refer back to (this repo).


<!-- ### Files:

The course was divided into sections. I used 'sec+num-' as a prefix for each .ts file. The titles don't completely match the vids and some single .ts files may contain topics from several videos. -->
