## How?

### The Course:
I have been doing an amazing course by Colt Steele on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-typescript/

<br/>
<br/>

### Getting the most out of learning:

Here are some techniques I used to reenforce the learning process:

- Although sometimes sections and videos are short, I have spent a much longer practicing the points covered.

- I changed all of the examples in the videos and personalised them to reenforce the learn process.

- I would often watch the intro and then set myself the challenge of trying to solve the upcoming problems with

- Making notes and organising examples of .ts features for 'future me' so that I have cheatsheets and references to refer back to.


### Files:

The course was divided into sections, I used 'sec+num-' as a prefix for each .ts file. The titles don't completely match the vids and some single .ts files may contain topics from several videos.
